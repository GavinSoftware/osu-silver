# osu-silver
## What is osu!silver?
osu!silver is an external all-in-one mod menu created for the rhythm game osu! (only osu!std is supported at the moment), coded in C++. This repository is made only for reporting issues, the actual program is paid.

This program when released will come with multiple modes, one being IPC (Completely External), and possibly in the future Normal (Semi External). Normal Mode may or may not be added.

## External Features (* = May/May not be added)

### Aim/Tapping
Aim Assist - Helps you aim towards circles/sliders

Relax - Taps the notes for you

### Visuals

Funny Overlay - Creates an overlay to allow you to play without extra visual effects, for example if you are using HDFL, you would see notes normally. It also gives you the option to change AR. (ENABLE BORDERLESS MODE FOR IT TO WORK)

### Replays
Replay Timewarp (*) - Allows you to create replays and play at a slower playback speed, so it's basically external timewarp.

## Normal Mode Features (* = May/May not be added)

### Playback Speed
Normal Timewarp (*) - Slows down/Speeds up the game depending on what value you set it on

### Visuals
Approach Rate Changer (*) - Changes the AR of a map

Hidden Remover/Flashlight Remover (*) - Allows for removal of the flashlight overlay/hidden visual effects

## Progress so far
Aim Assist has been added and is working really well.

Funny Overlay has been added, but I'll have to add approach circles and fix the circles not actually appearing, otherwise the overlay won't work.

Will be adding Relax after overlay, then maybe Replay Timewarp.
